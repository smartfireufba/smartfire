Fire emergencies cause serious damage to Brazilian Federal Universities. 
An appropriate and efficient tool to prevent or at least detect such events early are such events early are the multisensor networks coming from the Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we present the stages of development of a WebGIS system that integrates with IoT that allows the detection and helps in the management of such incidents.

The approach consists of a network of multipurpose sensors that are able to identify different sources of fire hazards. If a potential source is registered, information about environmental conditions is transmitted in real time to the system. Depending on the severity level, an alert is issued and/or the location of the incident can be sent to via an application to WebGIS. 

There, the location is represented on a map. The entire system consists of single board devices. The software components are based on open source tools. The entire network only needs little power and therefore, theoretically, could be realized as a standalone system powered by battery power. The entire system was tested with flame, temperature, gas, smoke and humidity sensors. The experiments carried out allowed to demonstrate the potentials, disadvantages and recommendations regarding the proposed integration
